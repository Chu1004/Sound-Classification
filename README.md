# Sound-Classification
It's a python project about classification of human voice, noise, and instrument. 
We divided the code into 4 parts.
First, we need to acquire the data from the link we set.
Secondly, we split the data into train and test set.
Then, we will train the model by RandomForestClassifier.
Finally, we analyze the data by our output, including the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
